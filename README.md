# Introduction
Hello, my name is Alex Sip, I am from Rhode Island. This is my second semester in MESM, studying what I studied as an undergrad, wildlife conservation bio. I was highly recommended to get more experience/schooling to prepare for the real world. Also, beginning a career search and starting one sounds really intimidating. During MESM, I hope to be proficient in GIS and when I graduate, I picture myself studying any animal outdoors, in tropical environments.
